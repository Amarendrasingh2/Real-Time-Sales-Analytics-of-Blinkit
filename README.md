# Real-Time Sales Analytics of Blinkit

This repository contains the capstone project focused on building a real-time sales analytics system for Blinkit. It leverages Power BI, SQL, Excel, and DAX to provide live, actionable insights into sales data to support business decision-making and operational efficiency.

## Overview

E-commerce platforms like Blinkit require instant access to sales performance metrics to make quick and informed decisions. This project demonstrates how real-time analytics architecture can support such needs through continuous data ingestion, dynamic visualizations, and intelligent modeling techniques.
